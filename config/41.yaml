title:       Wiring the Internet of Things with Raspberry Pi & Node-RED 
description: |
            <p><a href="nodered.org" title="Node-RED website">Node-RED</a> is a visual tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. Used together with Raspberry Pi it provides a compact, powerful platform that is able to read sensors, control outputs, and send and receive data to and from the Web and other systems.</p>
            <p>This workshop will provide an introduction to Node-RED and integrating simple sensors and outputs, applying basic processing and publishing data to the Web. No prior experience with either Node-RED or electronics is required. However, while not strictly necessary, some experience of JavaScript would be beneficial as this is used to implement custom functionality within Node-RED.</p>
            <p>The introduction to Node-RED will be presented by Andy Stanford-Clark.</p>

            <p><em>Please bring a laptop and, if you have a Raspberry Pi, bring this along with any useful sensors and LEDs. However, note that boards and sensors etc. will also be made available for use by those who do not have these. An SD card image will be provided with Node-RED and associated software pre-installed.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Note: Please aim to arrive by 12:15 as the workshop will start at 12:30 prompt.</strong></p>

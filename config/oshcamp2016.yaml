            <h3 id="talks">Saturday :: Talks</h3>

            <h4>LabRTC — progress at the Open University on instant real-time control of lab hardware that's half a world away</h4>
            <p id="LabRTC">Now that web infrastructure is finally delivering on the promises made in the 90s, instant real-time interactions with live hardware on the other side of the world are a reality. For example, we have recently been testing a rotating pendulum that can be controlled from a mobile phone, tablet or PC, from anywhere in the world, with no noticeable lag in the video feed.</p>
            <p>This approach is at the core of the new <a href="https://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=28618">openSTEM lab being created at the Open University</a>, as part of a £2.7M HEFCE project. The Open University are world leaders in connecting knowledge with distance students, and are now tackling the challenge of linking distance students in their homes with state of the art hardware on our campus, yet achieving the same response times as if they were in the same room with it.</p>
            <p>This talk will present core aspects of the technology behind our new openSTEMlab for electronics, as well as give you a teaser of the open-source version of our software that we are developing for eventual release to our students (and you) for use with open-source hardware in your own projects. Attendees will also be given the opportunity to remotely access activities in the openSTEMlab itself over coming months, as it enters alpha and beta phases ahead of the first electronics courses going live in October 2017.</p>
            <p id="TimDrysdale" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Tim Drysdale - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/timothydrysdale">Dr Tim Drysdale</a> is a Senior Lecturer in electronics at The Open University, leading the development of the openSTEMlab and the creation of two new electronics courses.

            <h4>Openly Educating the Next Generation of Engineers</h4>
            <p id="OpenlyEducating">In this talk we take a look at technical education past and present and discusses how it can benefit from open hardware.</p>
            <p id="KenBoak" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Ken Boak - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/monsonite">Ken Boak</a> got his first soldering iron on his 6th birthday, and was introduced to electronics by his father, by constructing crystal sets together.</p>

            <p>Ken studied Electronic Engineering at the University of North Wales, Bangor, and then went on to work for BBC Research Department on the then, fledgling HDTV systems.</p>

            <p>Since leaving the BBC in 1994, Ken has held 10 permanent positions, plus several contract jobs across a wide range of hardware disciplines.  Ken still enjoys tinkering with the latest hardware and has interests in FPGAs, soft core processors and educational hardware.</p>

            <h4>Indie Manufacturing</h4>
            <p id="IndieManufacturing">Is there a scale of production between craft and mass-manufacture?  Does it work for consumer products?  Can local suppliers - particularly across the <a href="http://makerbelt.org.uk/">UK Maker Belt</a> in the North - help us bridge the gap and scale up?  Adrian McEwen will share what he's learnt exploring the issues and building a new IoT product as part of the <a href="http://futuremakespaces.rca.ac.uk/">RCA Future Makespaces &amp; Redistributed Manufacturing</a> project.</p>
            <p id="AdrianMcEwen" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Adrian McEwen - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/amcewen">Adrian McEwen</a> is a technologist and entrepreneur based in Liverpool. He has been connecting devices to the Internet since 1995 — first cash registers, then mobile phones, and now anything from bubble machines to wave energy prototypes.

            <p>Adrian concentrates on how the Internet of Things intersects with people’s lives and how heterogeneous networks of devices should work together, and lectures and speaks on these issues internationally.</p>

            <h4>Keeping your project on track</h4>
            <p id="KeepinOnTrack">This talk will look at a project from inception through to the "end product". It will look at the various stages: research, design, hardware development and software development, debugging and fault finding. It will consider the possible choices you have at each stage. It will look at the tools that are available to help your development, such as IDEs, debuggers, and so on.</p>
            <p>The example that will be used is a controller for model trains using "Digital Cab Control" ("DCC").</p>
            <p id="MelanieRhiannaLewis" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Melanie Rhianna Lewis - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/cyberspice">Melanie Rhianna Lewis</a> started a life long love of electronics as a child when her Dad helped her make a "crystal" radio with an ear piece, a coil of wire, a diode and a radiator! Melanie currently works for an embedded device consultancy near Bradford where she works developing Linux based devices using ARM and MIPS. In her spare time she can be found on roller skates hitting people.</p>

            <h4>Open Source and Feature Film Production</h4>
            <p id="OpenFilmProduction">Having researched and examined how open source has reached out into many areas of current working environments, Daniel Mulligan was struck by how little open source seems to be used within the film production community. It appearing that little has been developed for an entire production workflow and backbone, from the sensor and how it is used and manipulated, the colour science and workflow.</p>
            <p>Examples do exist, such as <a href="http://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces">ACES</a> (Academy Color Encoding System), providing a free, open source colour and look management architecture. This has been taken forward through the educational department of the <a href="http://www.oscars.org/">Oscars</a> and by established Industry practitioners, but being such a new subject has as yet to completely encompass the entire workflow.</p>
            <p>Thus seeking to further the understanding and appreciation of production processes we can create a diverse array of programs and hardware for filmmakers (and institutions) to provide unique opportunities for engagement with the principles of open source relating to film production, and by approaching the subject now and introducing hardware research with an ethical ethos and approach, the belief is that we can further educate those who would like to see open source become a stronger and more realistic proposition as it continues to thrive and develop. Learning, teaching and research are all encompassed in the entire pipeline for a production. Open content, open practice, open data, open access are all elements that can be attributed to open source for film and education. </p>
            <p>On this basis contact was established with Apertusº for their <a href="https://www.apertus.org/axiom">open source 4K camera hardware</a>. This has allowed us to tackle the subject fully by developing not only sensor technology but also the processing involved. We have currently had delivered the very first shipped Open Source 4K hardware camera and testing fully its capabilities. </p>
            <p>The aim is to create free and open technology and hardware, and make all the generated knowledge freely available to everyone, encouraging participation along the way. By developing this approach we can create a production pathway that includes subjects such as open data, open collaboration and open hardware and software.</p>
            <p>Open source film production is an emerging environment effecting production tremendously, and is a perfect example of collaboration and education developing in multiple areas for the future, and can all be developed with an extremely strong emphasis on hardware development with software support.</p>   
            <p id="DanielMulligan" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Daniel Mulligan - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/cinema_open">Daniel Mulligan</a> started in cameras (assisting and focus pulling), before then graduating up the ranks to Camara Operating for F1, BBC Dramas then 2nd Unit Cinematography for Feature Theatrical Productions.</p>
            <p>Daniel also started and privately ran a rental house supplying digital cameras, plus an onset/location company providing location post and digital camera workflows. This culminated just recently with a 2-3 year stint at Technicolor as their locations digital dailies supervisor, looking after projects such as Jupiter Ascending, Mortdecai and The Man from UNCLE.</p>
            <p>During this time Daniel has seen a few changes and re-iterations of the current digital workflows and it has struck him over time how much we do rely on proprietary systems for most delivery. And perhaps quite rightly so, as the delivery requirements for VFX to DI, to onset LUTs and more need that service.</p>

            <h4>The Things Network, a crowd sourced data network for the Internet of Things</h4>
            <p id="TTN">In November 2015 a group of geeks in Reading were inspired to create an Internet for the IoT, a community project that has grown legs and is up and walking. The great thing about this project is how is has built connections with many abstract groups in the area.

            <h4>Going Beyond the von Neumann Architecture with FPGAs</h4>
            <p id="BeyondVNAwithFPGA">The late 20th century was 0wned by John von Neumann's architecture and Alan Wood predicts that the 21st century will become Alan Turing's algorithmic playground. The current pinnacle of computation at the beginning of the 21st century is represented by peak Von Neumann Architectures (VNA), as more and more has been squeezed out of this arrangement, it has been clocked and optimised to it's very limits, and now it's shrinking cores are being, multiplied and integrated to their logical extreme.</p>
            <p>However, the next era of computation requires an exponential jump in performance per watt in order to tackle 21st century needs; regression, prediction, machine learning, complex real-time transforms, convolution kernels, neural networks and general artificial intelligence. In order to get anywhere near the efficiencies we see in nature with the human brain, for example, we need neuron computation operating at picojoule energies, which is not suited to VNA. Therefore we need a new primitive vocabulary of Turing Complete Engines which we can use to matrix, network and orchestrate real-time, real-world embedded helpers, bots, devices and robots.</p> 
            <p>In this talk Alan will explore first history leading to this millennial transition and indicate what to expect as one of this centuries most important developments (A.I.) unfolds, I will provide a peek into the emerging Turing playgrounds of hybrids, ASICs and focus on DIY/Opensource FPGAs approaches to influencing and playing a part in this exciting transition.</p>

            <h3>Practical Experiences with the Google Android Accessory Development Kit (ADK)</h3>
            <p id="ADK">The ADK is an exciting development platform that makes it possible to easily combine Android applications with custom hardware built around Arduino. Such combinations have the best of both worlds by enabling the creation of a mobile phone application with access to peripheral devices that is only limited by your imagination.</p>
            <p>This talk will cover two projects that extend what the phone can do by integrating both input and output devices. And will cover some of the dos and don'ts of using the ADK and associated IDEs. If time permits there will also be a demonstration with a quick run through of the code.</p>

            <h3>The Internet of Things and Arduino</h3>
            <p id="IoTArduino">As connecting hardware to the network becomes cheaper and cheaper we're seeing the rise of what is being called the Internet of Things, or “IoT” for short.</p>
            <p>This talk will give an introduction to the Internet of Things and explain how open hardware platforms such as Arduino are helping it grow.  With plenty of examples of IoT projects, from using sensors to map global radiation levels to bakeries that tweet when the bread is fresh out of the oven.</p>
            <p id="AdrianMcEwen" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Adrian McEwen - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/amcewen">Adrian McEwen</a> has been connecting odd things to the Internet since the mid-90s. Starting with cash registers, and then as part of the team who were first to put a web browser onto a mobile phone. As the mobile phone and set-top box work became more mainstream he dropped down a level to Arduino which led to Internet-enabled bubble machines and chicken-food silos...</p>
            <p>Adrian has been working with Arduino since 2008 — which is when <a href="http://bubblino.com/" title="Bubblino">Bubblino</a>, the aforementioned bubble machine which watches twitter, was created — and is charge of the Arduino Ethernet library.

            <h3>Developing Linux on Embedded Devices</h3>
            <p id="EmbeddedLinux">This talk will provide an introduction to developing Linux on embedded devices. Firstly we will look at the capabilities of popular boards such as the BeagleBone and the Raspberry Pi. Then using the example of a BeagleBone controller for a 3D printer the talk with explain how to develop for an embedded device. It will consider what comprises an embedded Linux software stack. The talk will discuss boot loaders, kernels and root filesystems. We will discuss what are the minimum software packages required in a root file system. The talk will then go on to consider the tools required to develop for an embedded target. It will look at what tools are available to help the embedded developer and speed up this development process. Once you have developed your software you need to debug it. The talk will look at what debugging tools are available for debugging embedded devices.</p>
            <p id="MelanieRhiannaLewis" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Melani Rhianna Lewis - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/cyberspice">Melanie Rhianna Lewis</a> started a life long love of electronics as a child when her Dad helped her make a "crystal" radio with an ear piece, a coil of wire, a diode and a radiator! At the same time the home computer revolution started and she would lust after the "build your own computers" advertised in the electronics magazines of the time. She never got one but did end up the proud owner of a BBC Micro. Melanie learnt everything she could about the machine and including assembler, operating systems, drivers, interrupt, and, thanks to the circuit diagram in the Advanced User Guide, digital electronics. After the BBC Micro came the Acorn Archimedes and so started a long relationship with ARM processors. In the 90s Melanie became interested in Linux and then developed one of the first ARM Linux distributions running on an Acorn RISC PC. The hobby became a job and Melanie currently works for an embedded device consultancy near Bradford where a lot of her work is still with ARM processors.</p>

            <h3>Interfacing the Raspberry Pi to the World — Everything you need to know about P1</h3>
            <p id="InterfacingPi">You've received your Pi, set up a web server on it and maybe played a few rounds of Quake. You're looking for a new challenge and suddenly the header on the corner of the board catches your eye. A quick Google search for "P1 Raspbery Pi" gets you to the eLinux wiki page on <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals">Low level peripherals</a>, and you suddenly realise that you can do all sorts of fun stuff by adding extra bits to your Raspberry Pi using this magical expansion port. Where do you start? Is it safe to connect a motor directly to the pins? What sort of interesting components are out there?</p>
             <p>In this talk we will look at the ways we can communicate with the outside world using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. We will explore the mechanical, electrical and software side of things and talk about a few example projects you can try at home, and the hardware limitations will be covered and workarounds provided.</p>

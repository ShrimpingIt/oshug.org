title:       Yanking the Chain: open source software compliance in the supply chain
description: |
            <p>With the ever increasing complexity of embedded device software stacks, coupled with the proliferation of  new mechanisms for distributing complex server software stacks, open source compliance has never been more important â€” or indeed more of a challenge.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, there are growing number of tools and methods at our disposal to support open source software compliance efforts. This 1-day event will feature talks and hands-on workshops covering a number of these, with insights into practical experiences and lessons learned.</p> 
            <p>The preliminary programme can be found below and please note that further details will be published in due course as additional sessions are confirmed.</p>

            <h4 id="IntroducingOpenChain">Introducing OpenChain</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.openchainproject.org/">OpenChain</a> is a scalable, flexible compliance programme, developed by the Linux Foundation. It provides a great foundation for businesses of all sizes to adopt appropriate practices and procedures in place to control development and supply chain risks. Already adopted by companies like Qualcomm, Toyota and ARM, it's equally applicable to SMEs.</p>
            <p id="AndrewKatz" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Andrew Katz" href="http://twitter.com/andrewjskatz">Andrew Katz</a> is a lawyer and former programmer who advises extensively on free and open source software and other opens.

            <h4 id="EclipseSW360">Eclipse SW360 - Open Source Management with Open Source</h4>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/sw360/">SW360</a> manages software components with their license compliance documentation in SPDX and allows for setting up bills-of-material to provide comprehensive documentation for products and projects.</p>
            <p>Organizations can use SW360 as a one-stop shop for sharing component information, tracking their usage in projects or products. This involves the handing of compliance information, but also, as an example, matching for vulnerabilities from data providers.</p>
            <p>As an EPL-1.0 licensed <a href="https://www.github.com/sw360">Open Source project</a>, it is highly customizable, letting organizations keep their confidential product development data on premises, and prevents them from becoming dependent on a single vendor. This presentation shows briefly features and a walk through the application to demonstrate capabilities and use cases of SW360.</p>

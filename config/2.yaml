            Open Source Hardware projects and a representative from <a href="http://payitforwardprinting.com/">Pay It Forward</a> on

            <h3 id='Licensing'>Free and open source software is mainstream. Free and open hardware isn't.</h3>
            <p>
            Andrew is increasingly involved in open hardware, and considers what, 
            if anything, is different about hardware which makes open projects a challenge, 
            and whether it is possible to construct a licence, like the GPL, 
            which has a copyleft element applicable to hardware.

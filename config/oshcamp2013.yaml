            <h3 id="talks">Saturday Talks</h3>

            <h4>The Importance of Mini Makers</h4>
            <p id="MiniMakers">14 year old Amy Mather discusses why the maker culture is so important to the younger generation and introduces us to her idea of a Mini Mini Maker Faire, where only under 18's would be able to exhibit their creations.</p>
            <p id="AmyMather" class=vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Amy Mather - Website" href="http://minigirlgeek.wordpress.com/">Amy Mather</a>, a.k.a. MiniGirlGeek, has been making and coding for 18 months with the guidance and support of the community that she found at Manchester's <a href="http://madlab.org.uk/">MadLab</a> and <a href="http://hacman.org.uk/">hackspace</a>. Amy was the closing keynote speaker at the world's first Raspberry Jamboree event, speaking alongside Professor Steve Furber and Pete Lomas of the Raspberry Pi foundation. Amy also presented at the inaugural event <a href="http://rsafuturemaker.tumblr.com/">RSA FutureMaker</a> event at London's Somerset House, where she also ran a workshop introducing attendees to the world of sewable electronics.</p>

            <h4>Building a Maker Business: Sharing, Education, Open Source and Conscience.</h4>
            <p id="MakerBusiness">How open are you prepared to be when starting a business? Explore the wonderful shades of grey in the moral and legal landscape, as well as the risks and benefits to your survival in those early days, with war stories from Pimoroni's first year of existence.</p>
            <p id="PaulBeech" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Paul Beech - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/pimoroni">Paul Beech</a> is a co-founder of <a href="http://pimoroni.com/" title="Pimoroni">Pimoroni</a>, makers of the Pibow, Picade and other things Raspberry Pi. He also designed the Raspberry Pi Logo, and was somewhat responsible for the short-lived Interactive DVD phenomenon. He lives in Sheffield, in the Pimoroni workshop, because that's where all the good toys are. He prefers small-scale subtractive manufacturing processes.</p>

            <h4>The @ShrimpingIt Manifesto</h4>
            <p id="ShrimpingIt">Electronics engineers find it trivial to build an Arduino-compatible circuit on a breadboard using components which are just one tenth the cost of an official Arduino board. The <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/">@ShrimpingIt</a> project curates open resources and projects so that everyone can progress their prototyping with simple components and materials, just like the experts. The approach delivers a whole host of benefits for those learning to prototype - not just saving money.</p>
            <p>We'll be introducing the project, sharing the choicest cuts from our year's experience running it, and featuring lots of the great spin-off projects people have built on our work. The @ShrimpingIt manifesto combines insights from open design and community engagement, arriving at a challenging standpoint of how beginner microcontroller projects should be designed, presented and taught for a better tomorrow.</p>

            <h4>Risking a Compuserve of Things</h4>
            <p id="RiskingCompuserveOfThings">More and more companies are staking a claim to be the platform for the Internet of Things. Should we be aiming for a more open Internet of Things? Is the platform for the Internet of Things not just the Internet? Adrian McEwen will be exploring some of the challenges in implementing the Internet of Things and suggesting ways to improve collaboration and interoperability.</p>
            <p id="AdrianMcEwen" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Adrian McEwen Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/amcewen">Adrian McEwen</a> has been connecting odd things to the Internet since the mid-90s.

            <h4>Measuring Energy Consumption in Embedded Systems</h4>
            <p id="EnergyConsumptionEmbedded">How energy-efficient are your programs and how long will your devices last on battery power?</p>
            <p>Particularly when writing bare-metal applications, we have a great deal of control over how much energy the processor and hardware connected to it consumes. In this talk I discuss how we can accurately measure the energy consumption of our devices, and techniques that we can use to extend battery life.</p>
            <p id="JamesPallister" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="james Pallister - Website" href="http://www.jpallister.com/">James Pallister</a> is a graduate of the University of Bristol, where he achieved joint First Class Honours in Computer Science and Electronics.

            <p>James returned to Bristol in October 2012, where he is studying for a PhD in low-power multi-core system design. He remains a Technical Advisor to Embecosm.</p>

             <h4>Polling is for Wimps — Asynchronous Communications for the Internet of Things</h4>
             <p id="PollingIsForWimps">They say that, if the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a screw. Don't get me wrong, I love REST. It's great for posting data and one-off access. However, REST is not a good way for IoT actuators to get their instructions from a controlling system. aul will discuss his experiences with Sockets, XMPP and MQTT. One of which will usually be a good solution for most implementations.</p>
              <p>In each case arguments for and against will be presented, in the context of systems that must operate in near real time with low power budgets. Relevant open source technologies will be referenced. For a case example we’ll use the MQTT system that Paul and Adrian Godwin have been building for an experimental, thermally-efficient new build home.</p>
              <p id="PaulTanner" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Paul Tanner - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/paul_tanner">Paul Tanner</a> is a consultant, developer and maker in wood, metal, plastic, electronics and software.

            <h4>A Basic Introduction to Interfacing for the Hardware Curious</h4>
            <p id="InterfacingIntro">So you've got a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone and now you want to connect some hardware to it. You know basically what you want to do but you're are feeling a little bit lost in the jargon. What is a GPIO pin? What is an SPI or I2C bus? What is a shift register? How do I get more outputs than I have pins? How do chose the resistor for an LED? How do I read the value of a push switch? What does 3.3V tolerant mean?</p>
            <p>This talk will look at the basics of hardware interfacing. It will describe the basics of the interfaces typical of embedded systems and how to approach programming them. It will discuss some very basic electronics theory that will be useful to the beginner hardware hacker. Finally it will give pointers as to where to look for further information.</p>
            <p id="MelanieRhiannaLewis" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Melani Rhianna Lewis - Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/cyberspice">Melanie Rhianna Lewis</a> started a life long love of electronics as a child when her Dad helped her make a "crystal" radio with an ear piece, a coil of wire, a diode and a radiator! At the same time the home computer revolution started and she would lust after the "build your own computers" advertised in the electronics magazines of the time. She never got one but did end up the proud owner of a BBC Micro. Melanie learnt everything she could about the machine and including assembler, operating systems, drivers, interrupt, and, thanks to the circuit diagram in the Advanced User Guide, digital electronics. After the BBC Micro came the Acorn Archimedes and so started a long relationship with ARM processors. In the 90s Melanie became interested in Linux and then developed one of the first ARM Linux distributions running on an Acorn RISC PC. The hobby became a job and Melanie currently works for an embedded device consultancy near Bradford where a lot of her work is still with ARM processors.</p>

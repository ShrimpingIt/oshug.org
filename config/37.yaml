            <h3>Open Source Consortium - an introduction</h3>
            <p id="OpenSourceConsortium"><a href="http://www.opensourceconsortium.org/" title="The Open Source Consortium">OSC</a> is a trade association which represents companies and individuals delivering solutions and advice based on Open Standards and Free & Open Source Software.</p>
            <p>As a trade association, OSC gives its members greater influence than they could achieve alone by providing a collective voice, and by supporting initiatives such as the implementation of open standards in public sector IT, the inclusion of open standards in school curricula and levelling the gender balance in the industry. At the core of its vision, OSC campaigns for the use of Open Standards in all aspects of public and commercial life, promoting the unique advantages of Free & Open Source Software and the independent expertise offered by members.</p>

            <h3>Notes from the first three months of an Open Source Microenterprise</h3>
            <p><em>&mdash;How I learned to stop worrying and love the Kickstarter</em></p>
            <p id="MicroenterpriseNotes">Starting an Open Source Hardware business is lot of work, even if you've spent 11 years running a different one. There are all sorts of things you've forgotten about and there are a whole host of new challenges as you try to do things the right way from the start. None of it is easy, but all of it beats having a 9-5.</p>

            <h3>But I didn't mean *that*</h3>
            <p id="NotThat">Accidents and incidents exploring relationships between corporations and the licenses they use to share, from Creative Commons to GPL.</p>

Matthew Bloch, Bytemark's MD, narrates his own company's successes, profitability and changes in strategy around this important social movement.</p>

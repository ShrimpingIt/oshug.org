description: |
             <p>The thirty-ninth meeting will feature an update on the HPSDR project, which we first heard about back in October 2010 at <a href="/event/5">OSHUG #5</a>. There will also be talks on Bluetooth Low Energy programming and OpenBeacon, and making drones play by the rules.</p>

            <h3>Low Power to the People - take back Bluetooth Low Energy control!</h3>
            <p><em>&nbsp;&mdash;Programming BLE the hard way: bare metal programming of nRF51 BLE tokens for fun and profit.</em></p>
            <p id="OpenBeacon">The talk will start with a brief overview of the Bluetooth Low Energy advertisement protocol and how to implement bare-metal BLE on top of the ARM-based nRF51 chip — without using the manufacturer provided Bluetooth stack. The general development flow will be explored along with some useful examples, closing with some mischief that can be caused using this knowledge :-)</p>
            <p>The latest version of the <a href="http://get.openbeacon.org/">OpenBeacon</a> tag design is supposed to be the ultimate hacking, fuzzing and pen testing tool for Bluetooth Low Energy. The hardware schematics and the PCB layout were released under the CC attribution license. We strongly believe that the future of the Internet of Things can be privacy enabled and can work distributed, without selling your soul to large cloud services.</p>
            <p id="MiloschMeriac" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Milosch Meriac — website" href="https://meriac.com">Milosch Meriac</a> has over 20 years experience in the information security business and hardware design. He is currently living in Cambridge where he works for ARM on securing the Internet of Things. In his private time he loves making and grokking things. He is currently playing with RGB strips to create <a href="http://blinkenstick.org">light paintings</a>.</p>
            <p>Milosch is the co-founder of active and passive RFID open source projects like Sputnik/OpenBeacon, OpenPCD and OpenPICC, and is committed to RFID related security research. He broke the iCLASS RFID security system and was involved in breaking Mifare Classic security.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Blinkenlights Stereoscope Core Team Milosch designed the 2.4GHz OpenBeacon-based dimmmer/Ethernet dardware that was used in the Toronto City Hall Installation. As one of the three maintainers of the former Xbox-Linux Project he helped to break Xbox security and to port the first Linux system to the Xbox. His focus is on hardware development, embedded systems, RF designs, active and passive RFID hardware development, custom-tailoring of embedded Linux hardware platforms, real time systems, IT-security and reverse engineering.</p>

            <h3>OpenHPSDR Update</h3>
            <p id="OpenHPSDR">A review of hardware and software progress of the <a href="http://openhpsdr.org/">High Performance Software Define Radio</a>, an open source hardware and software project being developed by an international group of ham radio enthusiasts.</p>
            <p id="JohnMelton" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="John Melton — website" href="http://g0orx.blogspot.co.uk/">John Melton</a> has held a ham radio license since 1984 and has developed several open source Linux applications, including ground station software for working digital satellites and software defined radios. He is a retired software engineer after 48 years developing software for several computer manufacturers including Burroughs Corporation, ICL, Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation.</p>

            <h3>Ruling Drones</h3>
            <p id="RulingDrones">The danger of drones not sticking to regulations have been a challenge that has been recently in the news. An attempt is being made to see if it would be possible to produce notification when regulation is breached. The plan is to use ArduPilotMega and use a modified version Arducopter so geofencing could be achieved in various areas and a GSM interface is going to be used communicate to the ground monitoring station. The modification of flight controller and ground controller in future would involve the ability to verify authenticity of the geofencing and update the geofencing over the air using GPRS/3G/433 Mhz link and usage of TPM to verify the changes to the code applied.</p>
            <p id="AnishMohammed" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Anish Mohammed — Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed</a> has been an electronics hobbyist and software hacker since his early teens. He spent almost a decade in research and development in security and cryptography. He has most recently developed an active interersts in crypto currency space and ethics of AI (Dexethics.com). He is currently on the board of advisors for Ripple Labs and EA Ventures. He is a confirmed UAV addict who owns a dozen AHRS/Autopilots, both open and partially closed, with interests in multicopters, fixed wings and rovers.</p>

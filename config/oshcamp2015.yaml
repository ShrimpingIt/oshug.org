            <h3 id="talks">Saturday :: Talks</h3>

            <h4>Research led reality – how rhetoric and research shapes the maker movement</h4>
            <p id="ResearchLedReality">Over the past 10 years there has been an exponential rise in research about makerspaces, alongside rhetoric about the ‘maker movement’ going mainstream.</p>
            <p>This talk will give a sweeping overview of the past decade, focusing on the relationship between rhetoric, research and reality – (is there more to it than alliteration?) It will attempt to answer these three questions:</p>
            <p>What are the promises of the maker movement and does the evidence built up by the research so far prove them? What does the research tell us about the differences between the UK and USA maker movement? Who is funding all the research and what are their motivations and agendas?</p>
            <p id="HannahStewart" class=vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Hannah Stewart - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/Freerange_Inc">Hannah Stewart</a> is a Research Associate at the Royal College of Art and an independent researcher. Alongside Andrew Sleigh she was commissioned to produce the UK Makerspaces Open Dataset for NESTA.

            <h4>Confusion of Things — The IoT Hardware Kerfuffle</h4>
            <p id="ConfusionThings">While the definition of the term IoT (i.e: Internet of Things) is as cloudy as the “cloud”, everyone seems to be doing it. With excitement levels reaching stratospheric levels, the amount of buzzword-driven articles and colourful (and oh so unnecessary) abstract vector drawings that depict toasters communicating with cars have essentially made lives of many engineers who just want to build things a living hell.</p>
            <p>This talk will strip back the layers of marketing and aim to answer the question: “Which hardware platform should you use for building connected devices?”. With the plethora of chips/single board computers and specifically IoT-branded offerings out there, the platform choice does get a little difficult at times. By breaking down the application at hand into certain key requirement categories, this process could be simplified. There will also be mention of some of the most popular hardware platforms and how they differ from each other.</p>
            <p id="OmerKilic" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Omer Kilic - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/OmerK">Omer Kilic</a> is an embedded systems engineer who likes tinkering with small computers of all shapes and sizes.

            <h4>Disrupting the IoT by leveraging the ESP8266 for big data</h4>
            <p id="DisruptingIoT">The ESP8266 is as a cheap, self-contained WIFI module; for £3 you can add WIFI to your microcontroller project.</p>
            <p>Recently, the toolchain for compiling custom firmware for the module's SOC has been ported to the Arduino IDE, making it possible for beginners to deploy the ESP8266 as a complete IoT wireless sensor/actuator.</p>
            <p>This talk will cover: ESP8266 capabilities, the rest of the ESP8266 family members, using the module as a WIFI gateway with AT commands, uploading your own firmware using the recent Arduino port, and projects utilising the module.</p>

            <h4>Speculative Hardware in Abstract Culture</h4>
            <p id="SpeculativeHardware">Derek will talk about open hardware as a speculative practice in abstract culture. Derek's talk will be grounded in his experience with the Arts Council England R&D projects at the Digital Research Unit 10 years ago that commissioned innovative DIY/open hardware and audiovisual software tools and software art released under a free/open licenses. His talk will work with the design-fictional concept of noise to explore the function of open hardware in abstract culture. In the talk Derek will give a brief account of abstract culture in contemporary practice where artists are directly involved in making hardware and software works realised by the use of free and open source technologies.</p>

            <h4>How to Openwash Your Product and Make Your Millions!</h4>
            <p id="ProductOpenwash">Open Hardware has sparked a home brew electronics revolution. The current wave of 3D printers, drones and development boards are in the most part built on Open Hardware. As a result Open Hardware or Open Source Hardware have become terms with which many new products would like to be associated with, it’s rare to see an electronics Kickstarter project without the claim of being Open Source. It would seem however that in some cases the understanding of what constitutes Open Hardware is different to the original definition.</p>
            <p>Openwashing is a term that refers to dubious vendor claims about openness, and assumes, perhaps wrongly, that the misunderstanding of the Open Source definition is intentional.</p>
            <p id="BenjaminGray" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="Benjamin Gray - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/phenoptix">Benjamin Gray</a> is a proponent of Open Hardware, founder of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phenoptix/mearm-pocket-sized-industrial-robotics-for-everybo" title="MeArm">MeArm</a>, an open source robot arm manufacturer and phenoptix, a now retired maker business.

            <h4>Introducing a fun documentation standard to share your project</h4>
            <p id="DokuBricks">DokuBricks is a new open source hardware (OSH) documentation software we developed to make it easier for you to document your project well. After all, sharing instructions in a way that is useful to others is the whole purpose of OSH! With the tool, you click together your documentation in a descriptive and modular fashion and create dependencies. An associated database allows to easily reuse functional modules of projects, which in turn grows the impact and recognition of the creator of the original project.</p>
            <p>The ideas behind this free and open source documentation standard will be presented along with other OSH projects of ours in the Cambridge network. Our vision is to make OSH development and sharing easier and specifically more attractive to scientists - a group that develops a large amount of functional devices on a routine basis but rarely shares that insight.</p>
            <p id="TobiasWenzel" class="vcard"><a class="fn url" title="TobiasWenzel - website" href="http://steiner.bss.phy.cam.ac.uk/people/tw347@cam.ac.uk">Tobias Wenzel</a> "Tobey" is a Winton Scholar at the University of Cambridge who channels most of his enthusiasm into his Bioengineering work.

              <h4>Low level Ethernet on micros and FPGA</h4>
              <p id="LowLevelEthernet">Forget about ISO 7 layer abstractions, Berkley sockets, huge APIs and even operating systems. This is about taking direct control of Ethernet hardware with a micro or even an FPGA and finding that it’s not that hard. Standard C code running on an ARM CortexM4 micro supporting ARP, UDP and enough ICMP to PING ! And a quick tour of doing the same thing in VHDL on a low cost FPGA.</p>

               <p id"3DModellingNodejs">Come along and learn how to use the open source <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/frameworx" title="NPMJS - Frameworx library">Frameworx</a> library and some simple Javascript code to quickly build beautiful and intricate 3D models ready to send to your printer or favourite 3D print agency.</p>
               <p>Fractal trees, structural trusses, jewellery, molecular models - if it's made of sticks Frameworx can model it!</p>
               <p id="BenJefferson" class="vcard"><u>Ben Jefferson</u> is a software engineer who initially trained as an architect (as in buildings not Ben was tech director at Leeds based web agency Sense Internet for 10 years and is now a freelance software engineer and IT consultant. His combined interest in structures, fractals, computing and innovation set Ben on a mission to model and 3D print a "Fractal Truss". After trying many different open source 3D modelling packages Ben found that none of them leant themselves to fast algorithmic generation of multi-million facet 3D models - thus Frameworx was born. Frameworx is now used all over the world including in labs working at the cutting edge of 3D printing technology.</p>
               <p><em>Workshop notes: bring along a laptop which has node.js and MeshLab (or similar STL file viewer) installed. A basic knowledge of Javascript coding is required.</em></p>

               <h4>A hands-on introduction to ESP8266: Sensors for the Home</h4>
               <p id="HandsonESP8266">This workshop will introduce attendees to the popular low-cost WiFi enabled ESP8266 platform and go through a series of practical exercises focusing around a sensor device for the home. The device will get temperature/humidity, PIR activity and ambient light readings from the sensors on the purpose built demo board and report them back to the local “hub” and/or a cloud service.</p>
               <p>The exercises will run on the NodeMCU firmware, which is based on the Lua programming language. Before we get to the sensor readings part, there will be a quick introduction to the language and the platform with trivial exercises such as controlling GPIOs, using timers and various other fundamentals.</p>
               <p>Run by: <a href="#OmerKilic">OmerKilic</a>.
               <p><em>Workshop notes: bring along a laptop (Windows/Linux/OSX), your charger and a Micro USB cable. Please have your root/admin credentials handy in case you need to install any required software components during the workshop.</em></p>

               <h4>Learn KiCad by building an ESP8266 sensor board</h4>
               <p id="KiCADESP8266">The ESP8266 is a WIFI gateway for microcontrollers. It can also have its firmware replaced with custom code that makes it even easier to build distributed sensors.</p>
               <p>KiCad is a free, open source, electronics CAD tool for designing circuit boards. It's recently undergone a rapid expansion and change due to CERN funding. Consequently lots of documentation is now out of date.</p>
               <p>In this workshop you'll learn how to use the new KiCad by building a circuit board that provides the ESP8266 with 3.3v regulated power from a 5v input (easily powered with a phone charger), headers for serial programming and a temperature or light sensor.</p>
               <p>Thanks to our workshop sponsors OSHPark, each participant will get vouchers to have their board made free of charge.</p>

               <p><em>Workshop notes: please bring a laptop computer with KiCad installed. Note that installation can take quite a while as it needs to be compiled from source code.</em></p>

               <h4>A £100 3D printed digital microscope, anyone?</h4>
               <p id="3DPrintedMicroscope">3D printing brought incredible examples of Open Labware to life. My personal favourite (to be published soon): My colleague Richard Bowman's Raspberry Pi driven digital microscope, about the size of two fists, which allows a sample positioning of 1micrometer for X,Y and Z axis with its 3-printed flex-structures. Fun for you and Christmas for your kids!</p>
               <p>The kit (3D printed components and other bits including an optional raspberry pi) will be made available. The exact cost will depend on the 3D printing contractor I will use but should lie significantly under £100. At home you can extend the microscope in order to automate the three axes, if you wish.</p>

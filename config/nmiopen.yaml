            <h3>Session 1: Challenges & Opportunities</h3>

            <h4>Open Source: The Enabler for IoT Greatness (and Mediocrity)</h4>
            <p id="GreatEnabler">Strip the layers of marketing fluff on the shiny new Internet of Things devices and you will find, in almost all cases, a slew of great Open Source projects powering these little gadgets, to perform their intended duties. Go up a layer and guess what — the cloud is full of Open Source too!</p>
            <p>This talks uses IoT as a case study in explaining how Open-Source makes rapid iterations and complex interconnected things happen very quickly. While this all sounds great, we will also look at how certain approaches in "openness" actually cause more problems than they solve especially when it comes to interoperability between ecosystems.</p>

            <h4>Sailing the open seas</h4>
            <p id="OpenSeas">Deciding to operate a business with an 'open source' mindset, and looking beyond "why would you give everything away for free?", there are interesting business models to be had. Those invariably come with challenges, but also have the benefits that are derived from maintaining a culture of openness. <a href="http://www.boldport.com/" title="Boldport website">Boldport</a> is a small business that open sourced their primary internal software tool, PCBmodE, and who releases all their hardware designs as 'open source hardware'. We'll discuss where 'openness' is challenging and where it has created opportunities, all with a hardware perspective.</p>

            <h3>Session 2: Practical Solutions</h3>

            <h4>Red, Amber, Green: Free and Open-Source Software in the Supply Chain – When to Avoid, Tread Carefully and Embrace</h4>
            <p id="RedAmberGreen">Almost all software projects have an aspect of open source: and for very good reason. With reference to client case studies, Andrew considers how to maximise the utility of open source code, both in terms of the code itself, and engaging with the communities around it, and mitigating risk throughout the supply chain.</p>

            <h4>Open Source Tools for the Electronics Systems Industry</h4>
            <p id="ToolsForES">This talk will explore the huge range of open source tools that are available to electronics systems engineers; EDA tools such such as Icarus Verilog, GHDL, Verilator and SystemC, along with embedded software development tools such as GCC, LLVM, SDCC and Eclipse. We will consider their status, robustness as products and how to ensure they are supported for business critical use.</p>
            <p>We'll also look at the some of the important legal implications of adopting open source tools in your work flow, particularly when such tools are also supplied to customers. For example, does the source code of an open source compiler expose important information about your processor architecture that you would rather keep secret.</p>
            <p>The talk will conclude by looking at some of the open source tools projects under development, which while not ready for production use today, may bring about radical changes in the future.</p>

            <h3>Session 3: First Hand Experiences and the Future</h3>

            <h4>Establishing a Corporate Open Source Group: Journey and Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p id="CorporatePolicy">Creating a dedicated Open Source Group within a large consumer focused company such as Samsung is both challenging and rewarding. This talk recaps a 3-years journey, lessons learned and highlights some of the significant challenges still remaining. The talk is particularly relevant to any organization that is relatively new to Open Source and uncertain about the practicalities of engaging in it. During this talk Gurj Bahia will cover various topics from process changes for open source contributions, legal aspects such as licenses and IP, cultural changes to learn why and how to deal with the open source community to technical changes to allow a smooth way of communicating and collaborating between your internal team and the external community.</p>
            <p id="GurjBahia"><a class="fn url" title="Gurj Bahia - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/GurjOnTheLine">Gurj Bahia</a> leads the European office of Samsung’s Open Source Group.

            <h4>Open Source Field Programmable RF Technology Driving Innovation in Wireless Networks</h4>
            <p id="FPRF">The wide spread use of programmable digital technology has enabled a vast array of new wireless applications to be created. In fact, much of the innovation in wireless networks that has supported such a growth in recent years could be attributed to ever increasing levels of functionality within the digital chipsets. On the other hand, RF technology has been providing fixed function for a given design with very little in the way of programmability and flexibility. As we move from one generation of wireless technology to another, this issue has become more prevalent to the extent that today’s RF technology has become a bottleneck, hampering innovation in the design and implementation of future networks.This talk presents the concept of Field programmable RF technology where flexibility is extended from digital to RF domain. Use cases and application areas where such technology is making a significant impact is also presented where the Open Source community are getting behind the technology  and driving a Significant level of innovation in the field.</p>

            <h4>lowRISC – an Open-Source System-on-Chip Design</h4>
            <p id="lowRISC">lowRISC is a not-for-profit project aiming to produce the 'Linux of the hardware world', providing an open-source System-on-Chip design for industry, academia, and the wider open source community to build upon. This talk will update on lowRISC's current status and explore the challenges facing open source hardware projects along with the potential benefits of a more open hardware ecosystem. It will also briefly cover tagged memory and minion cores, both novel features which demonstrate the lowRISC approach to creating a secure, flexible, and extensible SoC architecture.</p>
